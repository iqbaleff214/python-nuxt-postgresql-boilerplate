# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Full-Stack Boilerplate: Nuxt.js + FastAPI

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a full-stack boilerplate application that provides a production-ready foundation for web application development. The stack consists of a Nuxt.js frontend with Tailwind CSS and a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL, complete with authentication (including 2FA), profile management, user management, email integration, real-time in-app notifications via WebSocket, background job processing, cloud storage integration, and Docker support.

---

## 2. Goals

- Provide a reusable, scalable boilerplate that can be forked and adapted for any web application project.
- Implement a secure, complete authentication system with 2FA support out of the box.
- Enable superadmin-level user management for operational control.
- Support transactional and notification emails via an email service integration.
- Deliver real-time in-app notifications via WebSocket.
- Offload long-running or scheduled tasks to a background worker system.
- Support cloud storage (S3-compatible) for file uploads with a local fallback for development.
- Ensure the entire stack runs consistently across environments via Docker.

---

### 5.6 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

#### 5.6.1 Setup
- Authenticated users can enable TOTP-based 2FA from the security settings page.
- Backend generates a TOTP secret and returns a `otpauth://` URI and a QR code (as a data URI).
- User scans the QR code with an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
- User confirms setup by submitting a valid TOTP code — 2FA is only activated after successful confirmation.
- Backend generates and returns 8 single-use recovery codes upon activation; stores them as hashes.
- Recovery codes are shown **once** and must be saved by the user.

#### 5.6.2 Login with 2FA
- After valid email/password, if 2FA is enabled:
  - Return a `mfa_challenge_token` (short-lived, 5 min, single-use).
  - Frontend redirects to a 2FA verification page.
  - User submits a 6-digit TOTP code or a recovery code.
  - Backend verifies the code and, if valid, issues the full access + refresh tokens.
- Brute-force protection: max 5 wrong TOTP attempts before the challenge token is invalidated.

#### 5.6.3 Disable 2FA
- User can disable 2FA by providing their current password and a valid TOTP code.
- All existing recovery codes are invalidated.
- User receives an email notification that 2FA was disabled.

#### 5.6.4 Recovery Codes
- User can regenerate recovery codes (requires current password + valid TOTP code).
- Old codes are invalidated immediately on regeneration.
- Each recovery code is single-use and marked as consumed after use.

---

### 5.7 Real-Time In-App Notifications (WebSocket)

#### 5.7.1 Connection
- Authenticated users connect to `ws://<host>/ws/notifications` using their JWT access token (passed as a query param or initial message).
- Backend validates the token on connection; unauthenticated connections are rejected.
- Connection is maintained per user session; multiple tabs/devices are supported.

#### 5.7.2 Notification Types
Initial supported notification types:

| Type                   | Trigger                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `account.status_change`| Admin activates, deactivates, or bans user   |
| `account.role_change`  | Admin changes user's role                    |
| `security.2fa_disabled`| 2FA disabled on the account                  |
| `security.password_changed` | Password changed or reset               |
| `system.announcement`  | Superadmin broadcasts a message to all users |

#### 5.7.3 Notification Payload
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "account.status_change",
  "title": "Your account has been deactivated",
  "body": "Contact support for more information.",
  "read": false,
  "created_at": "2026-03-23T10:00:00Z"
}
```

#### 5.7.4 Persistence
- All notifications are persisted in the `notifications` table.
- Users can fetch their notification history via REST (`GET /api/v1/notifications`).
- Mark notification as read: `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/:id/read`.
- Mark all as read: `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/read-all`.
- Unread count accessible via `GET /api/v1/notifications/unread-count`.

#### 5.7.5 Delivery
- When a notification is created, the backend:
  1. Persists it to the database.
  2. Pushes it to the user's active WebSocket connection(s) in real time.
  3. If the user is offline, the notification is delivered on next connection via a "pending" fetch.
- Broadcasting to all users (system announcements) fans out via Redis pub/sub to all backend instances.

---

### 5.8 Background Jobs (ARQ + Redis)

#### 5.8.1 Worker Setup
- ARQ (async Redis queue) is used as the job queue.
- A dedicated `worker` Docker service consumes jobs from Redis.
- Jobs are defined in `backend/app/jobs/`.
- Worker is horizontally scalable (multiple replicas consume the same queue).

#### 5.8.2 Registered Jobs

| Job                        | Trigger                                      | Description                                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `send_email`               | Any email-triggering event                   | Send transactional email via configured provider |
| `send_notification`        | Any notification-triggering event            | Persist + push WebSocket notification         |
| `cleanup_expired_tokens`   | Scheduled (cron, daily)                      | Delete expired/used tokens from `tokens` table |
| `hard_delete_accounts`     | Scheduled (cron, daily)                      | Hard delete accounts soft-deleted > 30 days   |
| `broadcast_announcement`   | Superadmin triggers via API                  | Fan out system notification to all users       |

#### 5.8.3 Job Configuration
- Max retries: 3 (with exponential backoff).
- Job timeout: configurable per job type.
- Failed jobs are logged with full traceback.
- Scheduled jobs (cron) defined as ARQ cron tasks in the worker settings.

#### 5.8.4 Monitoring (Dev)
- ARQ dashboard or Redis Commander available in dev Docker Compose for queue inspection.

---

### 5.9 Cloud Storage

#### 5.9.1 Backends
- **Local** (default for development): files stored at a configurable local path, served as static files.
- **S3-compatible** (production): supports AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO; configured via env vars.
- MinIO included as a Docker service in development for local S3-compatible testing.

#### 5.9.2 Stored File Types
| Category      | Max Size | Allowed Types            | Path Pattern                   |
|---------------|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| User avatars  | 2 MB     | JPEG, PNG, WebP          | `avatars/{user_id}/{filename}` |

#### 5.9.3 Upload Flow
1. Client sends multipart form data to `POST /api/v1/profile/avatar`.
2. Backend validates file type (MIME sniffing) and size.
3. Backend uploads the file to the configured storage backend.
4. Backend returns the public URL and updates `users.avatar_url`.
5. Previous avatar file is deleted from storage on replacement.

#### 5.9.4 Signed URLs (S3 mode)
- Private buckets are supported; the backend generates pre-signed read URLs with short TTLs when serving private files.
- For public-readable buckets (e.g., avatars), the raw CDN URL is stored and returned directly.

#### 5.9.5 Storage Service Interface
The `StorageService` abstraction exposes:
- `upload(file, path) → url`
- `delete(path)`
- `get_signed_url(path, expires_in) → url`

Both local and S3 backends implement this interface, making the storage backend fully swappable via config.

---

### 5.10 API Design (REST + WebSocket)

- RESTful API with versioning (`/api/v1/...`).
- WebSocket endpoint at `/ws/notifications` for real-time events.
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs available at `/docs` (disabled in production by default).
- All protected REST routes require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.
- WebSocket authentication via `?token=<access_token>` query parameter on connect.
- Consistent JSON response envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "...",
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { "page": 1, "total": 100 }
}
```

- Standardized error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation error",
  "errors": [{ "field": "email", "detail": "Invalid email format" }]
}
```

#### Frontend Key Modules
- **Auth Store** (Pinia): manage access token, user state, refresh logic, 2FA challenge state.
- **Notification Store** (Pinia): unread count, notification list, real-time push via WebSocket.
- **WebSocket Composable** (`useNotifications`): manages WS connection lifecycle, auto-reconnect, token refresh on reconnect.
- **Route Middleware**: `auth` guard, `guest` guard, `superadmin` guard, `mfa` guard (blocks full app until 2FA step complete).
- **API Composable** (`useApi`): typed HTTP client with auto token refresh.
- **Toast Notifications**: success, error, info system-wide.
- **Form Validation**: using VeeValidate + Zod or valibot.

## 7. Docker Setup

### Services

| Service    | Image                    | Port (host:container)    | Notes                          |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| frontend   | node:22-alpine           | 3000:3000                |                                |
| backend    | python:3.12-slim         | 8000:8000                | API + WebSocket                |
| worker     | python:3.12-slim         | —                        | ARQ background worker          |
| db         | postgres:16-alpine       | 5432:5432                |                                |
| redis      | redis:7-alpine           | 6379:6379                | Job queue + pub/sub            |
| minio      | minio/minio              | 9000:9000, 9001:9001     | Dev-only S3-compatible storage |
| mailhog    | mailhog/mailhog          | 8025:8025, 1025:1025     | Dev-only SMTP catch-all        |

- `docker-compose.yml` for production (no MailHog, no MinIO — use real cloud providers).
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development with hot reload, MailHog, and MinIO.
- Worker and backend share the same image/codebase; entrypoint differs.
- `.env.example` provided for all services.
- Database migrations run automatically on backend startup.
- Health checks defined for all services.

---

## 8. Security Requirements

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor ≥ 12).
- All tokens stored as hashes in the database.
- Refresh token rotated on each use.
- TOTP secret encrypted at rest in the database (AES-256 or Fernet).
- 2FA recovery codes stored as bcrypt hashes; each is single-use.
- CORS configured to allow only the frontend origin.
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints: register, login, forgot-password, TOTP verify.
- HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie for refresh token.
- No sensitive data in JWT payload (only user ID and role).
- WebSocket connections authenticated on upgrade; unauthenticated connections are rejected.
- Input sanitization on all endpoints.
- SQL injection prevented by ORM parameterized queries.
- File upload validation: type, size, and content (MIME sniffing).
- Cloud storage bucket is private by default; files served via pre-signed URLs where needed.
